# Housing-Data-Analysis-using-Tableau
Welcome to my blog on Developing reports with Tableau. Tableau is a data visualization platform that focuses on business intelligence (BI), which is the analysis of business information. It has become very popular recently because of its flexibility and visual appeal. This BI tool lets organizations gain insights from their data and build visualizations.

Data analysis is a game-changer for optimizing business operations, empowering informed decisions and strategic planning. Recently, I worked on a project where I analyzed Housing data, designed an interactive dashboard, and visualized the insights using Tableau. In this article, I’ll walk you through my approach, from collecting the data to crafting the interactive dashboard.

## Objective
In this project, I have taken the data of houses in King County, Washington. Using the Data I have developed a Dashboard which will be helpful deciding in to search for a house in a particular area.

My wireframe for this project is,

Data Source
To get the Source data check my Raw data folder.

After importing the dataset, I started creating the Dashboard

## Creating Dashboard
First, create a separate sheet for the chart regarding the Distribution of Bedrooms from 1 to 8 and a separate sheet for the Distribution of Bathrooms.

I took only the average of House prices in a bin.

Then, I started to create a map for the Price range variation in each place.

In a separate sheet, I created the bar chart (i.e.) a Histogram of Prices to represent the distribution of house prices.

Heatmap was used to indicate the condition of the house depending on the view classified as poor, fair, Average, Good and very good.

To make the visualisation look better, I created a filter with Year and month in it which will be easily accessible.

And a filter to vary the Sqft Lot, Sqft Living and Year built.

Finally, it was ready to get all the sheets together in one Dashboard.

## Conclusion
This dashboard will be useful for people, searching for a house in King County.
It’s an interactive Dashboard which makes it more efficient.
The filters help in making a better view for the user.
You can check my Dashboard, which I made using Power BI.
